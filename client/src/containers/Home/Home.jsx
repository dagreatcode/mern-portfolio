                  <p className="card-text">
                    Welcome to my Portfolio. This application was made to show
                    the skills Iâ€™ve acquired on my journey. I started off as a
                    Musician and started working at Delta Airlines to support my
                    dreams at the time. Later on, I started working with python
                    and data on my own. But I still was hungry for more. I felt
                    that I was maybe learning things I didnâ€™t need to know or
                    learning things and missing things I may have needed from
                    looking at YouTube videos. Covid came around and I volunteer
                    took a leave they offer the company. They said it would help
                    a lot for a number of reasons. So I took the opportunity to
                    help out and leave into a new career. I chose Web
                    Development. Ended up Graduating from Georgia Tech and Have
                    more skills than I ever could dream of having, including
                    self-awareness. My passion for development and problem
                    solving, and solutions to errors has made me a better coder.
                    Working with others makes any job better. With my work
                    ethic, I will work to make any project or job to be the best
                    version it can be.

                  I have a son with autism. Itâ€™s a lot but I know God would
                  never put too much on me I can not handle. This project. I
                  have been on a long road to finding myself. I had to let a lot
                  of people go because they did not want anything, but I wanted
                  everything. I have never given up on anything no matter how
                  bad it gets, I still seem to want to do more. Itâ€™s so easy to
                  give up, and I never want anything easy. This project was hard
                  but I still put my all into itâ€¦ I stay up long nights trying
                  to do it on my own. I have made a lot of mistakes. But I am
                  still pushing forwards.
