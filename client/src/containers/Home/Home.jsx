                  Welcome to my Portfolio. This application was made to show the
                  skills Iâ€™ve acquired on my journey. I started off as a
                  Musician and started working at Delta Airlines to support my
                  dreams at the time. Later on, I started working with python
                  and data on my own. But I still was hungry for more. I felt
                  that I was maybe learning things I didnâ€™t need to know or
                  learning things and missing things I may have needed from
                  looking at YouTube videos. Covid came around and I volunteer
                  took a leave they offer the company. They said it would help a
                  lot for a number of reasons. So I took the opportunity to help
                  out and leave into a new career. I chose Web Development.
                  Ended up Graduating from Georgia Tech and Have more skills
                  than I ever could dream of having, including self-awareness.

                    I have a son with autism. Itâ€™s a lot but I know God would
                    never but too much on me I can not handle. This project. I
                    have been on a long road to finding myself. I had to let a
                    lot of people go because they did not want anything, but I
                    wanted everything. I have never given up on anything no
                    matter how bad it gets, I still seem to want to do more.
                    Itâ€™s so easy to give up, and I never want anything easy.
                    This project was hard but I still put my all into itâ€¦ I stay
                    up long nights trying to do it on my own. I have made a lot
                    of mistakes. But I am still pushing forwards.
